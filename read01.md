# SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

## SMACSS
- Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS, also known as SMACSS is becoming one of the most useful contributions to front-end discussions in years. SMACSS is a style guide that provides a way to examine your design process and help you turn it into a more flexible process.

## Responsive Web Design
- Responsive web design is to build websites that will work on every device and every screen size. Others may refer to this as adaptiveness or mobile, however, these three terms are not interchangeable, Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related; responsive generally means to react quickly, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation.

## Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile
- The differences between responsive and adaptive design approaches spotlight important options for us as web and app designers. Choosing with insight can empower you to plan and execute your designs with better aim.

- Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. These will be further discussed in the sections below.

## Flexible Layouts
- Flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid. Flexible grids are capable of dynamically resizing to any width.
- Flexible layout adapts to different viewing conditions and different user requirements.
- These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.

## Logical Operators in Media Queries
1. Logical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions.
2. There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not and only.
3. Using the and logical operator within a media query allows an extra condition to be added.

## Height & Width Media Features
- One of the most common media features revolves around determining a height or width for a device or browser viewport. The height and width may be found by using the height and width media features

## Viewport 
- Mobile devices generally do a pretty decent job of displaying websites these days. Sometimes they could use a little assistance though, particularly around identifying the viewport size, scale, and resolution of a website. To remedy this, Apple invented the viewport meta tag.

## Media Features in Media Queries:
- Media features identify what attributes or properties will be targeted within the media query expression. Examples are as follows:

1. width, height.
2. orientation: landscape, portrait.
3. aspect-ratio.
4. resolution.
5. color, monochrome, grid.

## Problems with Floats
- Floats often get beat on for being fragile. The majority of this fragility comes from IE 6 and the slew of float-related bugs it has. As more and more designers are dropping support for IE 6, you may not care, but for the folks that do care here is a quick rundown.
