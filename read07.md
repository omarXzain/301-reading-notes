## REST
- intro
**it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web**

1.Servers send documents across the internet
2. HTTP lets the browser know what protocol to use
3. HTTP describes the location of anything on the web
4. The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”
5. REST provides a definition of a “resource” which HTTP points to Resources are just concepts not web pages
6. URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere
7. Browsers asks for the web page representation of the concept

- web pages are designed to be understood by people. A machine doesn't care about layout and styling. Machines basically just need the data. Ideally, every URL would have a human readable and a machine readable representation. When a machine GETs the resource, it will ask for the machine readable one. When a browser GETs a resource for a human, it will ask for the human readable one.
